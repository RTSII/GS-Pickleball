## 📋 Next Steps (In Order)

### **IMMEDIATE: Run Seed Script** ⚡

Before running the seed script, you MUST ensure your `.env` file is configured with valid Supabase credentials:

```bash
# Required in .env file:
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres.[PROJECT-REF]:[PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres"
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://postgres.[PROJECT-REF]:[PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres"
```

**Commands to run**:

```bash
# 1. Generate Prisma client (if not already done)
npx prisma generate

# 2. Run the seed script
npm run seed

# Expected output:
# 🌱 Starting seed...
# 🧹 Cleared existing data
# ✅ Created 10 venues
# ✅ Created 8 programs
# ✅ Created 3 coaches
# 📊 Seed Summary:
#    Venues: 10
#    Programs: 8
#    Coaches: 3
# 🎉 Seed completed successfully!

# 3. Verify in Supabase dashboard
# Open your Supabase project → Table Editor
# Check: Venue (10 rows), Program (8 rows), Coach (3 rows)
```

**Troubleshooting**:
- If you get connection errors, verify `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`
- If Prisma client errors occur, run `npx prisma generate`
- If foreign key errors occur, check migrations are applied

---

### **Task 5: Provision Typesense Collections**

Once data is seeded, provision search collections:

```bash
# Ensure Typesense env vars are set in .env:
# TYPESENSE_HOST="xyz.a1.typesense.net"
# TYPESENSE_PORT="443"
# TYPESENSE_PROTOCOL="https"
# TYPESENSE_ADMIN_KEY="your-admin-key"

npm run typesense:setup

# Expected output:
# Typesense collections ready.
```

This creates three collections:
- `venues` — with _geo, facets for indoor/lights/open_now
- `programs` — with start_ts, level filters
- `coaches` — with cities, rate filters

---

### **Task 6: Full Reindex**

Transform database data → Typesense documents:

```bash
npm run index:full

# Expected output:
# Indexed venues: 10
# Indexed programs: 8
# Indexed coaches: 3
```

**What this does**:
- Reads all venues from Prisma
- Computes `open_now` using `isOpenNow()` logic
- Adds `_geo` coordinates for distance sorting
- Adds `has_lessons` based on related programs
- Imports to Typesense with upsert

**Logs**: Check `logs/prisma-index-*.log` for details

---

### **Task 6b: End-to-End API Testing**

Test the search API with real data:

```bash
# Test 1: Search all venues
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/search/venues?q=&lat=33.7&lng=-78.9"

# Test 2: Filter by indoor
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/search/venues?indoor=true&lat=33.7&lng=-78.9"

# Test 3: Filter by open now (test during business hours)
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/search/venues?open=true&lat=33.7&lng=-78.9"

# Test 4: Search programs
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/search/programs?kind=lesson&level=3.0"

# Test 5: Typo tolerance
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/search/venues?q=pikleball&lat=33.7&lng=-78.9"
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Each query returns hits with proper structure
- Indoor filter excludes outdoor venues
- Open now filter respects current time
- Level filter returns correct programs (2.5-3.5 includes 3.0)
- Typo query still returns relevant venues

---

### **Task 10: Map Integration** (After Task 6b passes)

Add Mapbox to the homepage:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install mapbox-gl react-map-gl

# Add to .env:
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN="pk.your-mapbox-token"
```

**Files to modify**:
- `app/page.tsx` — integrate Mapbox GL with clustering
- Create `app/components/VenueMap.tsx`
- Create `app/components/VenueCard.tsx`

**Features to implement**:
- Clustered markers for venues
- Click marker → show venue card
- Sync map bounds with search results
- Facet filters update map

---

### **Tasks 11-12: Detail Pages**

Create detail pages for venues, programs, coaches:

```bash
# Files to create:
# app/venues/[id]/page.tsx
# app/programs/[id]/page.tsx
# app/coaches/[id]/page.tsx
```

**Venue page requirements**:
- Fetch venue by ID from Prisma
- Display: name, address, hours, amenities, fees, booking link
- Show "Open now" badge if `isOpenNow(hoursJson)` returns true
- Hide badge if `hoursJson` is null
- Link to programs at this venue
- Mobile responsive layout

**Program page requirements**:
- Display: kind, level range, dates, price, signup URL
- Link back to venue
- Show if currently open for signup

**Coach page requirements**:
- Display: name, credentials, rate, cities served
- Inquiry CTA (can be placeholder for now)
- Rating display

## 📝 Notes

### What Makes This Seed Data Realistic

1. **Real Geography**: Coordinates match actual Grand Strand locations
2. **Varied Hours**: Different venues have different operating hours
3. **Overnight Edge Cases**: PicklePort open until 00:30 (tests overnight logic)
4. **Mix of Venues**: Free public parks + paid private facilities
5. **Indoor Options**: Dink District, PicklePort (climate-controlled)
6. **Skill Range**: Programs span 2.0 (beginner) to 5.0 (advanced)
7. **Future Dates**: Programs start Nov 5-16, 2025 (upcoming)

### Design Decisions

- **Fees in cents**: Avoids floating-point issues (3500 = $35.00)
- **Timezone explicit**: All times use America/New_York
- **Booking URLs**: Real-looking URLs (will need verification later)
- **Phone numbers**: Use (843) prefix for Grand Strand area

### Known Limitations

- Contact info is placeholder (will need verification)
- Booking URLs are example domains
- No actual photos or detailed amenities yet
- Coach ratings are synthetic
