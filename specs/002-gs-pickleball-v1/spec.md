 # Feature Specification: GS Pickleball v1 Core
 
 **Feature Branch**: `002-gs-pickleball-v1`  
 **Created**: 2025-09-24  
 **Status**: Draft  
 **Input**: User description: "GS Pickleball v1 core feature (based on docs/specify.md scope)"
 
 ## Execution Flow (main)
 ```text
 1. Parse user description from Input
    ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
 2. Extract key concepts from description
    ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
 3. For each unclear aspect:
    ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
 4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
    ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
 5. Generate Functional Requirements
    ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
    ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
 6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
 7. Run Review Checklist
    ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
    ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
 8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
 ```

 ## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
 - ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
 - ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
 - üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers
 
 ### Section Requirements
 - **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
 - **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
 - When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")
 
 ### For AI Generation
 When creating this spec from a user prompt:
 1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
 2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
 3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
 4. **Common underspecified areas**:
    - User types and permissions
    - Data retention/deletion policies  
    - Performance targets and scale
    - Error handling behaviors
    - Integration requirements
    - Security/compliance needs

 ## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)
 
 ### Primary User Story
 A player in the Grand Strand wants to quickly find where to play now, see available programs and coaches, and get to a booking or contact action.
 
 ### Acceptance Scenarios
 1. Given a user in Pawleys Island, when they search with "indoor = true" and "open now = true", then results are sorted by distance and exclude outdoor-only venues.
 2. Given a venue detail view, when a booking/contact option exists, then at least one valid link or contact method is shown (200 OK or mailto/tel).
 3. Given program filters by date, level, and price, when filters are applied, then only matching programs are shown with clear level bands.
 4. Given a favorites action, when a signed-in user taps "favorite", then the venue/program/coach is saved to their account; if signed-out, it is saved locally on the device.
 5. Given calendar export, when a user exports a program/event, then the iCal file imports without errors in Apple Calendar and Google Calendar.
 
 ### Edge Cases
 - Overnight hours: Venues with hours spanning midnight correctly reflect "open now" across splits.
 - Missing hours: If hours are unknown, "open now" is hidden and an informational message is shown.
 - Geo denied: If location permission is denied, the user can enter a manual location and default to Myrtle Beach centerpoint.
 - No results: An empty state explains how to broaden search and suggests nearby public courts.
 
 ## Requirements (mandatory)
 
 ### Functional Requirements
 - **FR-001**: Provide map + list search with clustering and filters: indoor, lights, open-now, fee range, lessons available.
 - **FR-002**: Show venue pages with amenities, fees, parking notes, booking links, hours, and contact information.
 - **FR-003**: Provide program discovery with filtering by kind (lesson/clinic/league/ladder/tournament), level band, date, and price.
 - **FR-004**: Provide a coach directory with profiles (credentials, cities served, rates) and an inquiry CTA.
 - **FR-005**: Provide an event calendar with iCal export and import validation success criteria.
 - **FR-006**: Support favorites for venues/programs/coaches (account-based; fallback to local storage for guests).
 - **FR-007**: Support alerts via email digests (daily/weekly), respecting quiet hours (21:00‚Äì07:00 local) and per-category opt-out.
 - **FR-008**: Implement "open now" logic that is timezone-aware (derived from geo), DST-safe, and handles overnight intervals.
 - **FR-009**: Implement search relevance and typo tolerance with synonyms (pickleball/pickle ball, clinic/lesson, league/ladder); results sort by distance with relevance tie-breakers.
 - **FR-010**: Ensure accessibility: keyboard navigability, alt text, and conformance to WCAG AA automated checks.
 
 ### Key Entities (include if data involved)
 - **Venue**: Name, address, geolocation, amenities (indoor, lights), fees, hours (multiple intervals; overnight splits), booking/contact, tags.
 - **Program**: Kind (lesson/clinic/league/ladder/tournament), level_min/max, start/end, price, signup URL, capacity, remaining (optional), location reference.
 - **Coach**: Name, credentials, cities served, rate, rating, verified flag with evidence reference.
 - **Shop**: Services (retail/stringing/repairs/demo), contact, geolocation, notes.
 - **Event**: Title, start/end, description, URL; exportable as iCal.

## Notes
- This spec reflects the canonical product scope described in `docs/specify.md` and the Clarifications section applied on 2025-09-24.
 
## Clarifications Applied
- Favorites: Account-based; guests fall back to local storage.
- Alerts: Email digests (daily/weekly), quiet hours 21:00‚Äì07:00 local, per-category opt-out.
- Open-now logic: Venue-local time, timezone via geo lookup, DST-aware; supports overnight intervals.
- Search semantics: 25-mile default; sort by distance with relevance tie-breakers; weights `name^3, city^2, tags^2, amenities^1`; synonyms pickleball/pickle ball, clinic/lesson, league/ladder.
- Programs: Required fields include title, kind, level_min/max, start/end (ISO), price, location_id, signup_url, capacity; `remaining` optional.
- Security/Privacy: Mask PII in logs; 30-day retention for inquiries; public search 60 req/min/IP, server-side 600 req/min.

It is ready to proceed to `/plan`.
