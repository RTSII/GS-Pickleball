# GS Pickleball — Spec Kit Docs

Four Markdown files aligned to GitHub Spec Kit's slash commands:

- `constitution.md` — project principles and development guidelines.
- `specify.md` — product specification focused on the what and why.
- `plan.md` — technical implementation plan and architecture.
- `tasks.md` — actionable task list derived from the plan.

## Usage order
1) /constitution
2) /specify
3) /plan
4) /tasks

You can paste the contents of each file into your agent when using `specify init` and the slash commands, or keep them in the repo as living docs.
